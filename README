This program should help find gluten free restaurants near you and bus routes to get you there.

Python Dependencies:
	unirest
	rauth

Note: This uses the Mashape and Yelp APIs to coordinate restaurant and transit information, so you will need to sign up and get keys for both of them. You will need to export the following keys as environment variables:
	TRANSLOC_MASHAPE_KEY
	YELP_CONSUMER_KEY
	YELP_CONSUMER_SECRET
	YELP_TOKEN
	YELP_TOKEN_SECRET

Usage: You can use the find_guten_free_near_me(my_lat, my_long, search_radius=9000) function to find bus routes to gluten free establishment in your search radius.

	Here's a test example using the find_me() function (hardcoded to Slater Rd in Durham):

	>>> import gfree
	>>> gfree.find_guten_free_near_me(*gfree.find_me())
	{(u"P F Chang's China Bistro", u'6801 Fayetteville Rd, Renaissance Center at Southpoint, Durham, NC 27713,'): [u'4003038', u'4000088']}
